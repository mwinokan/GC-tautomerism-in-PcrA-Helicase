# GC-tautomerism-in-PcrA-Helicase

Simulation inputs and analysis code for the pre-print titled: "Multiscale model of tautomeric Guanine-Cytosine mutagens in the PcrA Helicase-DNA complex"

## Abstract

Proton transfer across hydrogen bonds in DNA can produce non-canonical nucleobase dimers and is a possible source of single-point mutations when these forms mismatch under replication. Previous computational studies have revealed this process to be energetically feasible for the guanine-cytosine (GC) base pair, but the tautomeric product (G*C*) is short-lived. In this work we reveal, for the first time, the direct effect of the replisome enzymes on proton transfer, rectifying the shortcomings of existing models. Multi-scale quantum mechanical/molecular dynamics (QM/MM) simulations reveal the effect of the bacterial PcrA Helicase on the double proton transfer in the GC base pair. It is shown that the local protein environment drastically increases the activation and reaction energies for the double proton transfer, modifying the tautomeric equilibrium. We propose a regime in which the proton transfer is dominated by tunnelling, taking place instantaneously and without atomic rearrangement of the local environment. In this paradigm, we can reconcile the metastable nature of the tautomer and show that ensemble averaging methods obscure detail in the reaction profile. Our results highlight the importance of explicit environmental models and suggest that asparagine N624 serves a secondary function of reducing spontaneous mutations in PcrA Helicase.

## Significance Statement

Proton transfer between the DNA nucleobases results in rare tautomeric forms that can cause mutations. Previous works have addressed the energy requirements of GC and AT tautomerisation but have failed to capture the effect of the enzymatic microenvironment in the model of DNA replication. In this study, we calculated the free energy profiles for the double proton transfer in GC in the presence of a bacterial PcrA Helicase enzyme, which plays a crucial role in unwinding DNA. We conclude that the presence of the Helicase destabilises the G*C* tautomer, potentially offering evolutionary protection from spontaneous mutation.
